In this document we will set up a project from the scratch and check its nuances.

mkdir -p ~/code/first01
cd ~/code/

~/code is the ROOT dir


1. create a virtual environment using venv - we will try with poetry later on 
   > python -m venv .venv
   > source .venv/bin/activate
   
2. pyproject-build   
   ERROR Source /Users/rav/code does not appear to be a Python project: no pyproject.toml or setup.py

3. touch pyproject.toml

4. ls   - list the contents of . folder
   first01     pyproject.toml

5. pyproject-build
   does a load of stuff , install setuptools , creates a dist folder ,
   inside dist folder a. .tgz which are the sources  b. .whl which is the binary distribution
   
6. ls 
   dist             first01          first01.egg-info    pyproject.toml
   
7. ls dist 
   UNKNOWN-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whl first01-0.0.0.tar.gz
   
   It shows UNKNOWN as we have not supplied meta information which can be done in pyproject.toml
   
8.
